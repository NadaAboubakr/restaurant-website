# HENA's restaurant
This folder contains different files representing different webpages in the restaurant website.
We designed it to be a simple and elegant at the sam time inspired by many existing websites in the same field.
This is a pair project where we implemented different scripting languages like HTML, CSS, Java Script for validation and PHP to connect the database

please note:
- we placed our folder in the directory "C:\xampp\htdocs" which is the way we used to run our php code 
- our stying sheet contains many unused classes due to our constant changes 
 
The website contains the following pages:
- a main page >> "index.php"
- contact >> "contact.php"
- login >> "login.php"
- menu >> "menu.php"
- reservation >> "reservation.php"
- registeration >> "registeration.php"
